In the initial stage, there is a small cat, and our goal is to navigate it through a maze and reach the finish line. We can control the cat's movement by pressing different buttons: up, left, right, and down. When we successfully guide the cat to the finish line, a message "You Win! Would you like to play again?" will be displayed, indicating that we have completed the maze. If the player chooses to play again by selecting "Yes," the game will restart with a new maze. However, if the player chooses "No," the game will stop as it is.
